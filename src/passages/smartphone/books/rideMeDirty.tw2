&emsp;They're going to claim her. Together. She just doesn't know it yet.

&emsp;Catherine's life is in New York and the property she's inherited is in Bridgewater, Montana. However, she often returns to the town she visited every summer as a child which stirs up long, forgotten memories and a heartbreaking crush.
&emsp;The feelings she had were not just for one man either, but two in the form of cousins: Jack and Sam Kane. When she developed the crush, they were hot teens but now, as she returns to the town, she finds the hot teens have turned into smoking-hot cowboys. Fortunately for her, in Bridgewater, one cowboy's never enough...

&emsp;In this contemporary version of Vanessa Vale's USA Today bestselling, Bridgewater MÃ©nage series, Catherine is forced to make a decision. She must choose between being the big-city lawyer or the small town cowgirl with two men who want to take her for a very dirty ride...

~Several Hours Later~

You lick your lips... Imagine being Catherine in the hottest threesome ever...
