Hello, my nickname is Maria (MariaMod), and this is my game.
(All characters are 18 years old, any illegal things are just typos, Big Brother is watching you)
And consider playing via PC since some magic bugs appear and disapper when you are playing via mobile device. There's nothing I can do, sadly

Have fun, comrades!

<strong><u>Main Pics Folder has been updated! The last version is 7.6.0</u></strong>
<strong>Important news (if you play Offline version)!</strong>
You should download the Main Pics Folder ( https://MariaMod.site/download/YM-MainPicsFolder.zip ) to get all pics. You download that .zip file and merge the "pics" folder you found there with the "pics" folder I added to the last version .zip file ( https://MariaMod.site/download/YM-Offline.zip ).
