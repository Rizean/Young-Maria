						Actually, yeah. Most of my teachers are great guys. They're calm and understanding. <br />
						It's nice to learn from them. <br />
						But... <br />
						My English teacher annoys me. <br />
						He constantly thinks his subject is more important than the others.
					@@
					@@.mc-text; Oh... Have you tried to reason with him? @@
					@@.bc-text;
						Of course! <br />
						But he always has the same response; "Hey kid, I'm the teacher here. English is the epitome of your life. You can't surive without it. Besides, how can you call yourself English if you don't know it?"
					@@
					@@.mc-text;
						Seriously? Does he not understand how stupid that sounds?
					@@
					@@.bc-text;
						Apparently not...

					@@.mc-text;
					  Damn, what an ass... But hey, I wouldn't worry about it. <br />
					  Someday you're gonna show him that you can be successful without having your life revolve around English and him.

						For sure...

					@@.bc-text;
						Yeah, sure. Most of them are nice, decent people. <br />
						A few of them have become some of my best friends. Others are mostly just classmates, you know?  <br />
						We help each other in the classroom but that's where our relationship ends. <br />
						Sometimes though, I admit, we hardly get any work done in class... <br />

					  Nah, those are just rumors... <br />
					  I know a lot of the girls and they aren't sluts. <br />
					  I mean, they may look like and act like they are but they're not. In fact, most of them are actually really down-to-earth girls.

					@@.bc-text;
						Of course! <br />
						I like pretty much all my subjects... Except English and Chemistry. <br />
						When I do Chemistry, everything else around me is more interesting. I get so distracted. <br />
						If Heisenberg taught Chemistry... Well, now that would be an entirely different experience.

						Yeah? You could probably become the most popular drug maker in the city.

						Do you like the way they teach at school?
					@@
					@@.bc-text;
						Not really... <br />
					  	The program is, surprisingly, pretty outdated. It'd be better if they taught us with more modern methods. <br />
					  	But this isn't the teachers' fault. They do the best with what they're given. <br />
					  	If anyone's to blame it's the government. They really need a new curriculum.
					@@
					@@.mc-text;
						Yeah, I can agree with that. But we can always study more at home and teach ourselves.
					@@
					@@.bc-text;
						They already give us enough homework. Study more and no-one will have any time for hobbies. Maybe that's why they do it...

					@@.bc-text;
						There are a few that have got my attention. <br />
						There's a lot of girls with attractive faces and gorgeous bodies. <br />
						And most of them are super nice to talk to. I enjoy spending time with them. <br />
						However, there are some that... Well, they don't scare me as such... Still I'd rather not go near them. <br />
						You should see them! They have piercings in several places and make-up as dark as a black hole. Most of their attire is thoroughly torn and they wear spikes on almost every article of clothing. <br />
					@@
					@@.mc-text;
						That sounds to me like they're goths... <br />
						Or at least they like more gothic clothing. <br />
						But is it really your place to judge? I mean, it sounds to me like they're just being themselves. I say all the more power to them. I wish I had that sort of confidence...
					@@

						Why? So you could go around wearing spiked collars and leather clothing?

						Why not? Sounds hot to me.

				<<case 'bullies'>>
					@@.mc-text; Have you ever been bullied? @@
					@@.bc-text;
						Oh... Yeah, I was once. <br />
						I was at my locker, getting books for the next class when they came up to me. They tried to insult me, but when I ignored them, they decided to be more physical. <br />
						Fortunately, my reaction speed is pretty good. One of them threw a fist that I dodged. When I threw a punch back, I clocked one of them right on the nose. <br />
						The dude crumpled to the floor, holding his nose and crying like a baby. It was the funniest thing. <br />
						I got detention for a week, sure, but now they never both me again. They still glare at me as I walk past.

					Heâ€™s a great guy. Not much older than me actually. <br />
					I guess that's why we work well together. Not to mention, it makes it easier to talk to him. Since he gets all my references. <br />
					We actually went to a bar once and he told me that he was thinking of giving me his job. It was only so he could climb the corperate ladder himself, but still...

				  Pretty good! The desks are close together but with enough space to not feel claustrophobic. <br />
				  The building is bright and clean, most of the time. There's also plenty of parking space so no-one's fighting over parking spots. <br />
				  There's also a shopping center nearby which is super useful when I want to grab lunch or just go for a walk in my break.

					Most of the people in our company are IT professionals, but the marketing department is also quite large.

					The marketing department is currently looking for a new recruit. But you'd have to have the appropriate experience and qualifications. <br />
					We do have testers though. <br />

				@@.bc-text;
					Pretty well. We have a lot of things in common so we bond a lot. <br />
					He also gives me plenty of advice for life. In exchange I keep him up-to-date with the newest and hottest trends.
				@@
				@@.mc-text;
					Seriously? Like what?
				@@
				@@.bc-text;
					Well, for example, dad's currently teaching me how to repair things. Sinks, toilets, TVs, etc. Soon there won't be anything I can't fix! <br />
				  Though at the moment he's helping me with my car. <br />
				 Whilst we're doing that, I tell him about the current music and clothings trends, the latest memes, the hottest celebrities and so on.
				@@
				@@.mc-text;
					Really? And what does he think about it all?
				@@
				@@.bc-text;
					Well, you know dad. When he sees a pretty woman, he always says "no beauty can compare to that of your mother's".  <br />
					But all in all, he's pretty open-minded. He's trying to understand the ways in which the world has changed from when he was a kid. Though he hates memes. <br />
					He says "what's the point in putting a caption with a picture? Surely not everyone understands the meaning?" He thinks that a joke having to rely on relativity isn't a joke at all and lacks originality.
				@@
				@@.mc-text;
					Seriously? That's hilarious. <br />
					Memes are, like, the foundation of our generation!

				@@.bc-text;
					I know right! But hey, he's old.

			<<case "mom">>
				@@.mc-text; How're you getting on with mom? @@
				@@.bc-text;
				  Mom's pretty cool. We don't have as much in common as I do with dad, but she tries. <br />
				  We mostly talk about what's going on in our lives. Relationships, hobbies, that sort of thing. <br />
				  In fact, we have a deal going right now. <br />
				  I help her with her computer problems and, in turn, she gives me advice on how to talk to girls. <br />
				  Some of her tips are a little outdated but, to my surprise, they actually work! <br />
				  Of course, she's much more up-to-date than dad so that probably helps.
				@@
				@@.mc-text;
					That's good. Mom definitely tries her best for us. <br />
					But if you needed advice with girls, why didn't you just come to me?
				@@
				@@.bc-text;
					Sorry, I didn't realise you had such a fragile ego, heh!
				@@
			<<case "parents">>
				@@.mc-text; What do you think of our parents? @@
				@@.bc-text;
					They're good together! <br />
					Though dad is more logical and rational and mom is more empathetic, they get on well. I guess what they say is true; opposites do attract! <br />
					As parents? They're pretty cool. They rarely swear, at least in front of us, and they're always showing support.
				@@
				@@.mc-text;
					Yeah, they're pretty great. <br />
					I don't think anything could ruin their relationship. <br />
					We're lucky to have such great parents.

				@@.bc-text;
					Oh, quite a while now. <br />
					Was probably a child when I last saw him. But I guess now that we're closer to his farm, we'll probably see him a lot more. <br />
					Unfortunately, that also means helping out more around the farm. Don't get me wrong, I like his farm but I'm not a country boy. <br />
					Getting down and dirty isn't really my thing but if it gets mom and dad off my back, then I'll gladly help anyday. <br />
					Plus, we get first dibs on his harvest! Nothing beats fresh produce...
				@@
				@@.mc-text;
					Yeah, the farm is a pretty dirty place. But I like how open it is. Do you remember the stories he used to tell us?
