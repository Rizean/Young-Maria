# Young-Maria - Refactored
This is a fork/refactor of [Young-Maria](https://github.com/MariaMod/Young-Maria)

## Notes
* This is very much and early WIP refactor
* I have years of coding experience but zero experience with Twine.js and/or SugarCube. As a professional coder I took one look at the twine editor and said no. It's a fine tool for the target audience.
* Twee2 has some issues, and it looks like the project has been abandoned. For now, I am working around the issues, but I may rewrite it from scratch. Once I get deeper in and have a clue what I can/can't do with Twine.js/SugarCube I should then know if I want to rewrite Twee2 or maybe Twee3.

## Goals
* Completely refactor Young-Maria and have it merged upstream
* Build a framework to make it easier to build `Mature` Twine.js games. As tribute to the original author I'm planing to call it Maria.js or something like that.


## Build/Run
* From project root: `https://github.com/Rizean/Young-Maria`
* Open `YoungMaria8.0.0_Offline.tw2.html` in a Modern browser
